# HW-02-Test-Portfolio

A mockup test portfolio website that is built with bootstrap and made responsive. I used mainly bootstrap for styling on the website with few overrides in my personal style sheet.

## What I did

Used Bootstrap to setup most of the website styling. Used "card" and "card body" classes for where the main information sits. This is within a "main" tag with container class which then holds the "div" tag that has row class. The use of the columns provided with bootstrap via the "col-" classes position the card and gave it the responsiveness at certain breakpoints. Spacing from bootstrap from the margin classes were used to make sure elements didn't stick to places it wasn't suppose too.

## Clean Code Guarantee

The use of HTML semantics where to give a quick look at where items where position on the page. There are a liberal amount of "div" tags but the use of HTML semantic tags where used at the beginning as to indicate where main components started and stopped.

Comments where used to explain what items are doing what as to not cause confusion if bootstrap changed syntax or something else needed to be changed in the future.

## How it Works

It should be responsive and able to be used on mobile devices with no problem. Links direct to correct webpages. It gives a decent description of the man behind the test project.
