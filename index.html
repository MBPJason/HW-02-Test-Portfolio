              Hi there, my name is Jason Ozulumba. I am currently a fullstack
              developer in training. I reside in Georgia and after years of
              learning web development off and on again, and one (maybe 5) ad
              later, here I am re-learning everything in Georgia Tech's
              Fullstack Fulltime Web Development Bootcamp. I am hoping to fully
              build an absolutely solid foundation of fullstack web development
              skills and become employee competitive immediately out of camp. I
              am choosing this hopefully as a good jumping point into the tech
              field so that I can have a job almost anywhere in the world and
              not have to worry about money as issue for the next 10 years at
              least. But this is only just the start...
            </p>
            <p>
              I am a 26 year old college dropout from the STEM field. I love
              videogames (shocker I know) and I am lover of sports. Since I was
              born in Boston, MA I am a huge Patriots fan and will take no bad
              talk about them unless the deserve it. Yes I am aware of the
              "cheating" scandals that a lot of people belive out there. Most of
              them are not truth and I can and will correct you an the truth if
              you come at me.
